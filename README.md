# Spotify-Playlist-Clone
Automation using Puppeteer and JS

Tech Used : JavaScript, Puppeteer

I always found creating new playlists a hectic task since Spotify didn't provide us with an option to clone playlists.
To overcome this issue, I made an automation project : Spotify Playlist Cloner in JavaScript using Puppeteer which dynamically fetches the songs from a pre-existing playlist, then creates a new playlist and adds all the songs of previous playlist to the new playlist.
